Credit Card Fraud Detection:

Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using advanced machine learning models. 
It includes a responsive web application with a user-friendly UI/UX design for visualizing and predicting transaction outcomes as either "Fraudulent" or "Non-Fraudulent.
 Additionally, it integrates data visualization tools like Power BI for enhanced insights into fraud trends.


 Features
Fraud Detection Models:

Machine Learning algorithms: Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor, Support Vector Machine, etc.
Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.
Web Interface:

Built using React.js for dynamic and responsive UI.
Users can input transaction data (amount and time) and receive instant feedback on fraud status.
Power BI Dashboard:

Visual representation of transaction patterns.
Heatmaps, frequency charts, and anomaly detection visualizations for analyzing fraud trends.
Mobile Responsiveness:

The web app is fully responsive and works seamlessly across devices, including mobile.


Technology Stack
Backend
Python: For training machine learning models.
Flask: To serve the prediction API.
Joblib: For saving and loading trained models.
Frontend
React.js: For building the UI.
CSS: For styling and responsive design.
Webpack: For module bundling.
Babel: For browser compatibility.
Data Visualization
Power BI: For creating dashboards to analyze fraud trends.

Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed on your system.
Node.js and npm installed for the React app.
A dataset file named creditcard.csv in the backend folder






Usage
Launch the React app from the frontend folder. It will open in your default browser (e.g., http://localhost:3000).
Enter the transaction details (amount and time) in the input fields.
Click the "Check" button to see whether the transaction is "Fraudulent" or "Non-Fraudulent."
For advanced insights, explore the Power BI dashboard to analyze fraud patterns and trends.
